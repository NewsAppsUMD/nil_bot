Bot of NIL data

Update 04/01:
What I've gotten done: This week, I switched over from pulling HTML contents from the On3.com website to pulling JSON. This required rewriting many parts of my code. I've gotten to the point now where I have a broad understanding of the new code and have used an annotated version of my scrape.py file to keep track of notes. I have developed an initial dictionary of the attributes to scrape from the On3.com website, and the code works in multiple cases.

Next steps: I think a realistic expectation is that by the end of next week, I will hopefully have code that pulls the data for Big Ten teams without error messages. To do this, I plan to try and use the tutorials on the W3schools.com website to troubleshoot as best as I can on my own. Unfortunately, I am not sure that I will get to the point with this project that I will be able to work too much on the output and end user experience with the data. I had initially hoped to output this data to a Datasette.

Blockers: The main blocker is that Python feels very new and unfamiliar to me, and it takes a lot of time and effort to figure out what are probably basic problems. There may also be some idiosyncrasies with the On3.com website that make it more cumbersome to run scraping code error-free. I am attempting to consult resources like W3schools.com, class examples (https://github.com/NewsAppsUMD/first-web-scraper-dwillis/blob/master/scrapers/wbb/roster.py, https://first-web-scraper-umd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and ChatGPT to problem-solve on my own, but it can be hard to decipher how to apply some of the directions to my particular problem.

I do feel some level of investment in this project and am interested in seeing it through a bit more than is likely by the end of next week. I am wondering if I can continue building this bot for my final project and work towards developing it into a news app.
